# Data Analysis of Crime Rates in Buffalo
## Introduction
We have performed a thorough analysis of the crime reports in Buffalo that have been reported from 2010 to the present. The dataset used for this analysis can be accessed at https://data.buffalony.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incidents/d6g9-xbgu. From the analysis, we have generated bar graphs that depict various factors associated with the frequency of crime incidents. Moreover, we have constructed a map that highlights regions where specific crimes occur on a regular basis. The map aims to alert the police department with the aim of preventing crimes before they happen. Ultimately, we have drawn conclusions on how the analysis will aid both the police department and society at large.
